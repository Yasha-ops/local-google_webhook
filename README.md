## About
'local-google_webhook' is a small project about how to catch request from
google assistant to treat them localy. Initialy the server was launched
from a raspberry, but i can totally fit on any platform.

## Launch the server
```
  npm install
  npm start
```
The server will listen on 3000 port by default. However u can
still change it in the server.js file
